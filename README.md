Using [Password Strength Tester](https://alecmccutcheon.github.io/Password-Entropy-Calculator/) with a randomly-selected password
generated by this tool, we can roughly expect about 290 entropy bits as calculated by Claude Shannon's way of calculating it, 370
entropy bits as calculated by the trigraph way of calculating it. 60-70 entropy bits is generally considered very strong, so this
should be sufficient until cloud providers deliver a stronger defense.

Requires makepasswd(1) tool at [khorben/makepasswd: Makepasswd generates (pseudo-)random passwords of a desired length](https://github.com/khorben/makepasswd/), which is available in many Linux distributions.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Rocky Linux, Fedora and distributions that use dnf:  
```shell
sudo dnf install makepasswd
```
In Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, Elementary OS and distributions that use apt-get:  
```shell
sudo apt-get install makepasswd
```
In Arch Linux, Manjaro and distributions that use pacman:  
```shell
sudo pacman -S makepasswd
```

As of April 2024, we could not find makepasswd in NixOS packages searching at:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=23.11&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=makepasswd  
Under NixOS, makepasswd(1) might need to be built and packaged from source. We opened Issue  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/308030  
requesting packaging of makepasswd(1). Also not found in Homebrew at https://formulae.brew.sh/.
